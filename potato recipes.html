            <h1 align="center"> Potato Stories!</h1>
            <p1>          Once there was a small potato named Truffle. Truffle lived a normal life in the potato garden, being a potato of the world. Every morning Truffle would; wake up, grow, get watered by the gardener, grow some more, sunbathe, and then go to sleep. Until the gardener went to the garden with a bucket…
	           Truffle was so scared when the gardener came to the garden. Truffle was being taken  away to a scary place called the Grocery Store!!  Once Truffle was at the Grocery Store he was in a bag full of other potatoes. So he was screaming “ IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD!!” But no one could hear him, since he was a potato.He was still screaming while he got scooped into another  bag and carried out of the store.when he got to the owners home he smelled something good. It was a big steaming pot of clam chowder!!! Truffle was so scared he ran to the couch and stayed there forever. And that is how you get a couch potato.
